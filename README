rc65 is a small program to allow RCS model RC-65 thermostats to be bridged
on to an xPL home automation backbone.

It can be run as a daemon, or in the foreground. There are command line options
to select the com port, thermostat address, log file, debug level, and
broadcast interface.For a complete list of command line options, type ./rc65 --help once the program is built.

The program is dependent on having xPLLib installed on your system.
